SE 363 Java Project

Project Details: 
• In the project there has to be 3 class inherited to each other. These classnames are MainClass, 
AnimalClass, DogClass and CatClass. Our program should run in MainClass 
• In our game we have virtual stage and virtual positions of animals in x-axis and y-axis and the range of 
our virtual stage is in x-axis 0-100, in y-axis 0-100, so stage is square… 
• We have 1 cat and 1 dog in our game which use AnimalClass as a superclass. And dog and cat objects 
has to created in MainClass 
• At the beginning user should enter dog and cat name. When user enters the name program should 
gives a message like “dogName is barked !, catName is meowed !” 
• AnimalClass has to be superclass of DogClass and CatClass 
• There has max. 1000 rounds in the game. And in every round program should give the round count with 
a message. i.e: “Round 4 - Round 5 - Round 6”… 
• In every round cat and dog positions changing randomly… 
• In every round cat and dog has to give their positions as message. i.e: “catName position is: 
(x:10, y:20), dogName position is: (x:35, y:60)” 
• If the cat and dog appear 5 units away between each other, program gives a “catName and dogName 
are fighting now” message. 
• If cat and dog appears at the middle of the stage (x:50, y:50), program ends and gives a message “Game 
is Over”
